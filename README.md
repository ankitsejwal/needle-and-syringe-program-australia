# Needle and Syringe Program
From the [health.vic.gov.au website](https://www.health.vic.gov.au/aod-treatment-services/needle-and-syringe-program)

- The Needle and Syringe Program (NSP) aims to minimise the spread of blood-borne viruses among injecting people who use drugs and onto the wider community.
- Sharing a used needle or other injecting equipment is one of the most effective means of transmitting bloodborne viruses.

This software aims to digitize the data capturing process to help the NSP teams to enter data through their mobile phones. Almost all of the NSP outreach team uses paper and pen to enter the details of the services they provide on day to day basis.
